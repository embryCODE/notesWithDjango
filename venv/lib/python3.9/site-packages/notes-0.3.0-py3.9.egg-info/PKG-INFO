        =============
        
        A simple application to allow you to attach notes to models.
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        Notes uses generic relations to handle attaching themselves to models. So installation is basically just like adding a generic relation item to your model.
        
        1. Add 'notes' to your INSTALLED_APPS variable
        2. Import the Note model:
        
                from notes.models import Note
        
        3. Add the note inline to your model's admin def in your admin.py file:
        
                from notes.admin import NoteInline
        
                class YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
                    inlines = [ NoteInline, ]
                
        4. To enable easy management you can add a hook to your model:
        
                notes=generic.GenericRelation(Note)
        
        Usage
        ------
        Follow the steps above (including 4) and you should have access to all the notes at instance_of_yourmodel.notes_set.all():
        
            >>> object = YourModel.objects.get(pk=1)
            >>> notes_for_object = object.notes_set.all()
        
        Simple.
